The project aims to develop a conversational chatbot that facilitates the
process of ordering burgers. The chatbot utilizes Amazon Lex, a service for
building conversational interfaces, to handle natural language interactions
with users.
It guides users through a series of prompts to gather all the necessary
information for placing an order. The chatbot incorporates validation logic
using Lambda function to ensure that the provided inputs are correct and
complete.
The chatbot is integrated into a static website hosted on Amazon S3 service
and it is connected to a Telegram bot using a third-party service called
Kommunicate.
